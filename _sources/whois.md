# Who are QUAREP-LiMi and WG12?

[QUAREP-LiMi](https://quarep.org/) is a group of light microscopists and image analysts from Academia and Industry all interested in improving quality assessment (QA) and quality control (QC) in light microscopy. 

Within Quarep-LiMi the Image Analysis and Visualization Working Group (Quarep-Limi WG 12: https://quarep.org/working-groups/wg-12-image-visualization-and-analysis/) is chaired by Helena Jambor and Christopher Schmied; it provides guidelines for scientists to publish accessible and understandable images, including their reproducible processing and analysis procedures. Publishing of light microscopy image data should include key information about image acquisition, image reconstruction, processing and analysis, as well as image visualization and image data availability (safeguarding e.g. in repositories).

WG12 will provide a white-paper, guidelines, training materials, teaching slides with example images, and an application of the guidelines in a video-tutorial. WG12 has members from academic and corporate research, and publishing. Members are active in image analysis, image publishing, image software design, and data visualization.
