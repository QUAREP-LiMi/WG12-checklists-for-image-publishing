# Frequently asked questions

## Why isn't X covered here?

There are a number of items these checklists could feasibly have covered; the final list is far from exhaustive. WG12 looks forward to expanding our guidance on a number of topics related to image analysis and/or visualization; see our [Contributing section](./contribute.md)

## You said X was SomeLevel, but I think it should be SomeOtherLevel, why wasn't it?

Reasonable people may disagree on the level categorizations for many items- all of the items on all checklists are good and worthwhile things to do. The categorizations reflect the collective agreement of WG12. Input and insight (and new WG12 members!) are always welcomed; see our [Contributing section](./contribute.md)

## You said to do X, but I don't know how

The [Scientific Community Image Forum](forum.image.sc) is a great place to search for questions other people have asked, and/or to ask your own question if you don't see it there already! Please do feel free to add the #quarep tag to your post. 

In time, WG12 hopes to produce and/or link to educational materials to aid in performing all of the checklist items detailed here.
