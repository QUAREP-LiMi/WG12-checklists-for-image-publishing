# Image format

Light microscopy images in publications can rapidly communicate useful details if they are prepared to be information dense, clean and containing the most important information/metadata the audience needs to see at a glance. A set of simple processing rules can focus the audience’s attention to the most relevant parts that are crucial for understanding the experiment and/or results. Consult the steps below to start your journey to create understandable and reproducible figures.

- [ ] <img src="images_icons/blank.png" height="25px"> Focus on relevant content
  - Crop empty/irrelevant pixels to focus the audience’s attention. Rotate images where required, ideally in 90 degree increments. Resize images to fit the intended panel size. 
- [ ] <img src="images_icons/blank.png" height="25px">  Separate individual images
  - A border between individual images makes distinction easier reducing the risk of confusion and mix up bot for the author and the audience.
- [ ] <img src="images_icons/blank.png" height="25px"> Show example image used for quantifications
  - Provide context and a dash of accountability by complementing a graph of results with one of the quantified images. 
- [ ] <img src="images_icons/blank.png" height="25px"> Indicate position of zoom-view/inset in full-view/original image
  - When the big picture is as important as the small details, show both. An indication of the position of the detailed image that must be highlighted to the audience is a valuable tool. 
- [ ] <img src="images_icons/blank.png" height="25px"> Show images of the range of described phenotype
  - As tempting as it may be to cherry pick the image that shows the nicest or most representative case, show the audience a flavor of everything: the good, the bad and the ugly.
