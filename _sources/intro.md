# Community-developed checklists for publishing images and image analyses

This book is a companion to the preprint [Community-developed checklists for publishing images and image analyses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07005).

In this paper, members of [QUAREP-LiMi](./whois.md) have proposed 3 sets of standards for publishing image figures and image analysis - minimal requirements, recommended additions, and ideal comprehensive goals. By following this guidance, we hope to remove some of the stress non-experts may face in determining what they need to do, and we also believe that researchers will find their science more interpretable and more reproducible.
